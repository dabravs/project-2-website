                    Amtrak’s losses have been growing astronomically year-over year. 
                    This trend began long before the COVID-19 pandemic, but the same year that the widespread illness hit the United States, 
                    the national rail company’s losses skyrocketed from the millions to the billions.

                    "Our customers trust Amtrak’s commitment to safety and are responding positively to the investments and improvements we are making," 
                    said Amtrak CEO Bill Flynn in Progressive Railroading. "We will continue to prioritize offering a modern, safe and reliable customer experience 
                    and preparing for what should be a monumental fiscal year 2022."

                    Despite the massive growth in losses, Amtrak’s customer revenue from passengers has been growing astronomically since Fiscal Year 2018. 
                    This is likely due to the fact that post COVID travel restrictions have led to increased domestic travel, including domestic rail travel. 
                    However, due to Amtrak’s operating expenses, these year over year gains are not yet coming to fruition for the company. 
                    Additionally, passenger revenues are not the only source of income for Amtrak.
                    If the company can further optimize its gains from freighter clients, it might be able to break even or turn a profit in future fiscal years.
